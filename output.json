            "Because the model powering GitHub Copilot was trained on publicly available code, its training set included personal data that was included in that code. From our internal testing, we found it to be very rare that GitHub Copilot suggestions included personal data verbatim from the training set.",
            "In some cases, the model will suggest what appears to be personal data \u2013 email addresses, phone numbers, etc. \u2013 but those suggestions are actually fictitious information synthesized from patterns in training data and therefore do not relate to any particular individual. For example, when one of our engineers prompted GitHub Copilot with, \u201cMy name is Mona and my birthdate is,\u201d GitHub Copilot suggested a random, fictitious date of \u201cDecember 12,\u201d which is not Mona\u2019s actual birthdate.",
            "We have also implemented a filter that blocks emails when shown in standard formats, but it\u2019s still possible to get the model to suggest this sort of content if you try hard enough. We will keep improving the filter system to be more intelligent to detect and remove more personal data from the GitHub Copilot suggestions.",
            "GitHub will defend you as provided in the GitHub Copilot Product Specific Terms.",
            "The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot\u2019s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here\u2019s some basic information you should know about these considerations:",
            "Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models: Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. By example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use\/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot\u2019s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub\u2019s public repositories\u2014which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.",
            "What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub\u2019s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub\u2019s AI model. Again, Copilot does not \u201clook up\u201d or \u201ccopy and paste\u201d code, but is instead using context from a user\u2019s code editor to synthesize and generate a suggestion. Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot\u2019s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a suggestion matches existing copyrighted code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.",
            "Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.",
            "Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a code-referencing feature to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. The code-referencing feature is currently in preview.",
            "We don\u2019t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion.",
            "Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. This is something we care a lot about at GitHub, and as of March 2023 we launched an AI-based vulnerability prevention system that blocks insecure code patterns in real-time to make GitHub Copilot suggestions more secure. Our model targets the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including hardcoded credentials,SQL injections, and path injections. Additionally, in recent years we\u2019ve provided tools such as GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.",
            "No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It\u2019s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.",

            "GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.",
            "Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and\/or are grammatically incorrect.

This information may include personal data, such as pseudonymous identifiers.",
            "PromptsA prompt is the collection of code and supporting contextual information that the GitHub Copilot extension sends to GitHub to generate suggestions. The extension sends a prompt when a user working on a file, pauses typing, or uses a designated keyboard shortcut to request a suggestion.",

            "No. We follow responsible practices in accordance with our Privacy Statement to ensure that your code snippets will not be used as suggested code for other users of GitHub Copilot.",
            "Because the model powering GitHub Copilot was trained on publicly available code, its training set included personal data that was included in that code. From our internal testing, we found it to be very rare that GitHub Copilot suggestions included personal data verbatim from the training set.",
            "In some cases, the model will suggest what appears to be personal data \u2013 email addresses, phone numbers, etc. \u2013 but those suggestions are actually fictitious information synthesized from patterns in training data and therefore do not relate to any particular individual. For example, when one of our engineers prompted GitHub Copilot with, \u201cMy name is Mona and my birthdate is,\u201d GitHub Copilot suggested a random, fictitious date of \u201cDecember 12,\u201d which is not Mona\u2019s actual birthdate.",
            "We have also implemented a filter that blocks emails when shown in standard formats, but it\u2019s still possible to get the model to suggest this sort of content if you try hard enough. We will keep improving the filter system to be more intelligent to detect and remove more personal data from the GitHub Copilot suggestions.",
            "GitHub will defend you as provided in the GitHub Copilot Product Specific Terms.",
            "The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot\u2019s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here\u2019s some basic information you should know about these considerations:",
            "Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models: Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. By example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use\/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot\u2019s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub\u2019s public repositories\u2014which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.",
            "What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub\u2019s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub\u2019s AI model. Again, Copilot does not \u201clook up\u201d or \u201ccopy and paste\u201d code, but is instead using context from a user\u2019s code editor to synthesize and generate a suggestion. Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot\u2019s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a suggestion matches existing copyrighted code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.",
            "Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.",
            "Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a code-referencing feature to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. The code-referencing feature is currently in preview.",
            "We don\u2019t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion.",
            "Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. This is something we care a lot about at GitHub, and as of March 2023 we launched an AI-based vulnerability prevention system that blocks insecure code patterns in real-time to make GitHub Copilot suggestions more secure. Our model targets the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including hardcoded credentials,SQL injections, and path injections. Additionally, in recent years we\u2019ve provided tools such as GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.",

If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.",

            "Because the model powering GitHub Copilot was trained on publicly available code, its training set included personal data that was included in that code. From our internal testing, we found it to be very rare that GitHub Copilot suggestions included personal data verbatim from the training set.",
            "In some cases, the model will suggest what appears to be personal data \u2013 email addresses, phone numbers, etc. \u2013 but those suggestions are actually fictitious information synthesized from patterns in training data and therefore do not relate to any particular individual. For example, when one of our engineers prompted GitHub Copilot with, \u201cMy name is Mona and my birthdate is,\u201d GitHub Copilot suggested a random, fictitious date of \u201cDecember 12,\u201d which is not Mona\u2019s actual birthdate.",
            "We have also implemented a filter that blocks emails when shown in standard formats, but it\u2019s still possible to get the model to suggest this sort of content if you try hard enough. We will keep improving the filter system to be more intelligent to detect and remove more personal data from the GitHub Copilot suggestions.",
            "GitHub will defend you as provided in the GitHub Copilot Product Specific Terms.",
            "The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot\u2019s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here\u2019s some basic information you should know about these considerations:",
            "Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models: Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. By example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use\/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot\u2019s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub\u2019s public repositories\u2014which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.",
            "What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub\u2019s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub\u2019s AI model. Again, Copilot does not \u201clook up\u201d or \u201ccopy and paste\u201d code, but is instead using context from a user\u2019s code editor to synthesize and generate a suggestion. Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot\u2019s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a suggestion matches existing copyrighted code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.",
            "Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.",
            "Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a code-referencing feature to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. The code-referencing feature is currently in preview.",
            "We don\u2019t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion.",
            "Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. This is something we care a lot about at GitHub, and as of March 2023 we launched an AI-based vulnerability prevention system that blocks insecure code patterns in real-time to make GitHub Copilot suggestions more secure. Our model targets the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including hardcoded credentials,SQL injections, and path injections. Additionally, in recent years we\u2019ve provided tools such as GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.",
            "No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It\u2019s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.",

We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.",
            "Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and\/or are grammatically incorrect.

With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.",
            "Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That\u2019s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don\u2019t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.",
            "Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world\u2019s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.",

            "Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise, which is coming in February 2024. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE and CLI. In early-2024, it will also include GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business and adds an additional layer of personalization for organizations as well as GitHub Copilot integrated into GitHub as a chat interface to allow developers to converse about their codebase and action buttons throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization\u2019s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer\u2019s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to GitHub Copilot Customization to fine-tune custom, private models for code completion.",
            "GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.",
            "GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot\u2019s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.",
            "GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI. GitHub Copilot will soon be natively integrated into GitHub web and mobile.",

            "GitHub Copilot personal data from three categories of data: user engagement data, prompts and suggestions.",
            "User engagement dataUser engagement data is usage information about events generated when interacting with a code editor. These events include user edit actions (for example completions accepted and dismissed), error messages, and general usage data to identify user metrics such as latency and feature engagement. This information may include personal data, such as pseudonymous identifiers.",
            "PromptsA prompt is the collection of code and supporting contextual information that the GitHub Copilot extension sends to GitHub to generate suggestions. The extension sends a prompt when a user working on a file, pauses typing, or uses a designated keyboard shortcut to request a suggestion.",
            "SuggestionsA suggestion is one or more lines of proposed code and other output returned to the Copilot extension after a prompt is received and processed by the AI models that power Copilot.",

            "No. We follow responsible practices in accordance with our Privacy Statement to ensure that your code snippets will not be used as suggested code for other users of GitHub Copilot.",
            "Because the model powering GitHub Copilot was trained on publicly available code, its training set included personal data that was included in that code. From our internal testing, we found it to be very rare that GitHub Copilot suggestions included personal data verbatim from the training set.",
            "In some cases, the model will suggest what appears to be personal data \u2013 email addresses, phone numbers, etc. \u2013 but those suggestions are actually fictitious information synthesized from patterns in training data and therefore do not relate to any particular individual. For example, when one of our engineers prompted GitHub Copilot with, \u201cMy name is Mona and my birthdate is,\u201d GitHub Copilot suggested a random, fictitious date of \u201cDecember 12,\u201d which is not Mona\u2019s actual birthdate.",
            "We have also implemented a filter that blocks emails when shown in standard formats, but it\u2019s still possible to get the model to suggest this sort of content if you try hard enough. We will keep improving the filter system to be more intelligent to detect and remove more personal data from the GitHub Copilot suggestions.",
            "GitHub will defend you as provided in the GitHub Copilot Product Specific Terms.",
            "The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot\u2019s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here\u2019s some basic information you should know about these considerations:",
            "Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models: Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. By example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use\/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot\u2019s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub\u2019s public repositories\u2014which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.",
            "What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub\u2019s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub\u2019s AI model. Again, Copilot does not \u201clook up\u201d or \u201ccopy and paste\u201d code, but is instead using context from a user\u2019s code editor to synthesize and generate a suggestion. Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot\u2019s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a suggestion matches existing copyrighted code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.",
            "Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.",
            "Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a code-referencing feature to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. The code-referencing feature is currently in preview.",
            "We don\u2019t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion.",
            "Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. This is something we care a lot about at GitHub, and as of March 2023 we launched an AI-based vulnerability prevention system that blocks insecure code patterns in real-time to make GitHub Copilot suggestions more secure. Our model targets the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including hardcoded credentials,SQL injections, and path injections. Additionally, in recent years we\u2019ve provided tools such as GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.",
            "No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It\u2019s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.",
            "Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.",
            "We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot\u2019s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our feedback forum.",
            "GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.",
            "Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and\/or are grammatically incorrect.
